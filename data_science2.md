- Distance in the Plane 

Recall that Pythagorean Formula is:
Z^2 = X^2 + Y^2

Distance Formula:
Dist(A,C)= Sqrt((C-A)^2 + (D-B)^2)

- Nearest neighbours
How far away is one point from another vs another point 

Lines in the Plane, Part I
Y - Y1 = M(X - X1) = point slope 

Y = Mx + b -> Slope, Intercept, Part 2

Slope M, is (Y1 - Y) / (X1 - X)


- Clustering

- Point slope formula of line 

If a line l has slope M and if (X, Y) is any point 
on the line then l has equation Y1 - Y = M(X1 - X)

If a line l has slope M and l hits the Y axis at the point 
(0, b) then y = mx + b is an equation for the line.
M is the slope and b  is the y intercept 

Functions from set to set 

f:A->B 
is a rule/ formula/ machine which transforms each A element A 
into f(a) element B 

Examples:

A = {1, 2, 10}
B = {Apple, DE, Monkey}

f: A -> B
f(1) = Apple

f(x) = x^2
g(x) = x + 5

If graph of f fails the horizonal line test, F has no inverse
