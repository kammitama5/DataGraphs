## Includes code I wrote for specific assignments 

- General Assignments; larger projects will be in another repo.
  These are from courses: 
  - Coursera Python Data Analysis 
  - Coursera Data Science Maths
  - Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Set Up
- Local is set up as standard
- Cloud9 set up

```
## to start up notebook
ipython notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8080 --no-browser
## use token to validate
## this is in the cloud publicly, so be careful what is in here
## to see notebook->https://instancename(topfolder)-username.c9users.io
```
## Types of Data
- XML
- JSON
- CSVs
- WebScraped data

## Notes
- Binomial Distribution
```
n!
-----
k!(n-k)!
```

## Normalization

- Normal distribution with mean and variance 
```
Area under curve

  1
----
(2 * pi * (sigma^2))^(1/2)
```

## Jupyter stuff

- draw a random number (n) of samples from data

```
randomnum = np.random.choice(data, n)
```

- calculate the mean of that sample

```
randomnum.mean()
```

- calculate the variance

```
np.var(randomnum)
```

- calculate standard deviation

```
np.std(randomnum)
```
